 🔍 K-Means Clustering for Crime Hotspot Detection

This module applies the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm** to identify crime hotspots based on historical crime data. The algorithm groups similar crime incidents together, helping law enforcement analyze crime-prone areas efficiently.

🚀 Features
- Clusters crime data based on geographical locations.
- Uses Folium to visualize clusters on an interactive map.
- Helps identify crime-dense areas for better resource allocation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language:Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Folium
- Database:MySQL Workbench (crime data storage)
- Visualization: Folium
