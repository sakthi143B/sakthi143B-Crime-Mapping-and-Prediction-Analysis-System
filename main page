🔍 Crime Mapping and Prediction  Analysis System

This project is a Crime mapping and Prediction Analysis System that helps law enforcement agencies analyze crime data, detect patterns, and predict crime-prone areas. The system is divided into two main parts:

-  Part 1: User Interaction Page – A web interface for users to log in, view crime data on maps, and interact with reports.
- Part 2: Crime Analysis Algorithms – Includes four crime analysis techniques for pattern detection and prediction.

 🚀 Features

 Part 1: User Interaction Page
- User authentication (Login/Signup)
- Crime data visualization on an interactive map
- View, add, and filter crime reports
- Designed using , MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

 Part 2: Crime Analysis Algorithms
1. Repeat Offender & Behavioral Pattern Analysis – Identifies repeat criminals and behavioral trends.
2. Spatiotemporal Crime Prediction (Time-Series Analysis) – Predicts crime trends over time and location.
3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering) – Detects crime hotspots through clustering.
4. K-Means Clustering Algorithm – Segments crime-prone areas based on geographical data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:  Python (for Part 1/2)
- **Database: MySQL Workbench
- Machine Learning:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Folium (for visualization)
